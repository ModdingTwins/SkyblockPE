## FOR DEVELOPERS

You can change SkyBlockCommand.php here:
https://github.com/TheFixerDevelopment/SkyblockPE/blob/patch-1/src/SkyBlock/command/SkyBlockCommand.php
On line 528, where the message comes in, saying an actual message.
Change it to your liking. But do not change anything else, unless you're a professional coder, and want to change a few things.
The reason why I blanked the /sb version message out, is because some people would like to leak the information, and would not think this would be ideal. If you disagree however, you can change it to your liking. By default, it's blanked out, but as I've said, you can change the "message" on line 528.


## TO-DO LIST:

* Updating /sb, with different colors, and liking's. Especially with /sb help. ✔
